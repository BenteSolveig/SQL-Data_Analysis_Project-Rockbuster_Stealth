# SQL-Data_Analysis_Project-Rockbuster_Stealth
Data portfolio project. Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a video rental service that is transitioning from world wide stores to a streaming service in order to stay competitive. The Rockbuster Stealth management team plans to use its existing movie licenses and wants to optimize the transition.

**Key Questions**

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

- What was the average rental duration for all videos?

- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Data**

The dataset utilized in this project includes information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, rental details, among other things and is provided by Career Foundry. It can be found here: http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip 

I analysed the Data using a relational database management system, specifically PostgreSQL. The underlying data originates from diverse datasets strategically linked through SQL queries, such as joins.
