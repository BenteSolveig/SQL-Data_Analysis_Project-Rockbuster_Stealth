# This SQL query containing a CTE finds out whatâ€™s the average amount paid by the top 5 Rockbuster Stealth customers.

#The CTE, named average_amount_paid_cte, is defined before
#the main query. This makes the code more modular and enhances readability,
#especially when dealing with complex queries. It separates the logic of finding
#the top 5 customers from the main query that calculates the average, making the
#code easier to understand and maintain.
