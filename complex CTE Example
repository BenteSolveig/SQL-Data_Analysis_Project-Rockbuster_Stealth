# This SQL query containing 3 CTE's finds out how many of the top 5 Rockbuster Stealth customers are based within each country.

/*
Here's a brief explanation for each CTE:

CTE_top_10_countries: Identifies the top 10 countries with the most customers.
CTE_top_city: Identifies the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries with the most customers.
CTE_top_customer: Determines the top 5 customers within the top 10 cities.

The main part of the query then aggregates the count of customers per country, both overall and considering the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the overall count of customers per country and limited to the top 5 countries.
The output provides information on the total number of customers in a country and how many of them belong to the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities.
