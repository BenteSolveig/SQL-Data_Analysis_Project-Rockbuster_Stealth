# This query employs both a main query and a subquery, containing 4 JOIN statements, to determine the average amount paid by the top 5 customers residing in the specified top 10 cities.

/*
Here's a brief explanation :

The first part (SELECT statement until opening parenthesis) initiates the main query, where we want to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

The subquery ( starting with the SELECT statement) retrieves data about customers from former identified top 10 cities with their total amounts paid. 
It joins the customer, address, city, country, and payment tables. 
It then filters the results based on the specified cities, groups the data by customer and city, and orders it by the total amount paid in descending order. 
Finally, it limits the result to the top 5 customers.

The main query ( After the closing paranthesis) concludes by taking the average (AVG) of the total_amount_paid from the subquery results. 
The result is aliased as average_amount_paid.
